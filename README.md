# Insurance-Risk-Analytics
Built an R-based underwriting analytics project using the US Health Insurance dataset to identify cost drivers and predict high-risk members. Engineered lifestyle interaction features and trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models evaluated via ROC-AUC, revealing smoking, BMI, and age as dominant actuarial risk factors.
